# Shortest Paths Management in Routing
Find and manage shortest paths in a network graph for routing and managing data flows. 
It implements a BFS algorithm to find the shortest paths between nodes, 
calculates weights for edges based on load and capacity, 
and then processes requests for data flows, 
optimizing the selection of paths based on weight and available capacity. 
Finally, it outputs the selected paths and associated data flows.
